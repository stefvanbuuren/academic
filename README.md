# academic

This repository contains the source of my academic website. The site uses 
`blogdown` in combination with the `hugo-academic` theme.

Use `blogdown:::serve_site()` to update the website after a source 
file is saved. The terminal command `./deploy.sh` will rebuild the website 
and upload the contents to `stefvanbuuren/stefvanbuuren.github.io`, 
from where it is published at https://stefvanbuuren.name.
