  abstract = {The main goal of this guideline for preventive child health care (PCHC) is to improve early detection of disorders that induce short stature. Based on research, evidence-based referral criteria for children aged 0-10 years with a short stature were formulated. These criteria are important for all professionals working with children, such as PCHC, general practitioners and paediatricians. Previous referral criteria dated 1997 and titled Diagnostics of short stature in children had a very low specificity and were therefore considerably revised. They should no longer be applied. The guideline also provides information on the cause of short stature, psychosocial aspects and the use of growth hormone.
