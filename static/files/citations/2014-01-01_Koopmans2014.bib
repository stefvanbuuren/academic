  abstract = {Recently, the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (IWPQ) version 0.2 was developed using Rasch analysis. The goal of the current study was to improve targeting of the IWPQ scales by including additional items. The IWPQ 0.2 (original) and 0.3 (including additional items) were examined using Rasch analysis. Additional items that showed misfit or did not improve targeting were removed from the IWPQ 0.3, resulting in a final IWPQ 1.0. Subsequently, the scales showed good model fit and reliability, and were examined for key measurement requirements (e.g., category ordening, unidimensionality, and differential item functioning). Finally, calculation and interpretability of scores were addressed. Compared to its previous version, the final IWPQ 1.0 showed improved targeting for two out of three scales. As a result, it can more reliably measure workers at all levels of ability, discriminate between workers at a wider range on each scale, and detect changes in individual work performance.},
