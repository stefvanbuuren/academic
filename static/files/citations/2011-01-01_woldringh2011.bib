  abstract = {Birth weight and longitudinal growth in the first 4 years of life of term singletons conceived with the use of IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) were compared with those of naturally conceived singletons. Although IVF and ICSI singletons had a statistically significantly lower birth weight than naturally conceived singletons, the average individual weight curves showed that this difference was lost before the age of 4 years in all subgroups: IVF, ICSI, boys, and girls.
