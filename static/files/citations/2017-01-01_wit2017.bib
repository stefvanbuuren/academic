  abstract = {Background/Aims: Childhood stunting is a prevalent problem in low-and middle-income countries and is associated with long-term adverse neurodevelopment and health outcomes. In this review, we define indicators of growth, discuss key challenges in their analysis and application, and offer suggestions for indicator selection in clinical research contexts. Methods: Critical review of the literature. Results: Linear growth is commonly expressed as length-for-age or height-for-age z-score (HAZ) in comparison to normative …},
