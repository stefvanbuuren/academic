  abstract = {Background We recently reported the age interval 2--6y being the earliest and most critical for adult overweight. We now aim to determine which age intervals are predictive of cardiometabolic risk at young adulthood.

By multiple regression analyses relationships were assessed between subsequent conditional BMI SDS changes and components of the},
